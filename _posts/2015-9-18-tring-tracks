If you are moving along with me, I was setting up an [alarming system](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/tracking-trings/) for [nerdspal community](http://nerdspal.com/Account/League) - secretly called **project tring**.

So, the **so awesome news** is that you can start tracking your tringing alarms. In other way - the project is succesfully finished. Looks like a party time.

Any [new notification](http://nerdspal.com/Home/Notifications) will be shown next to a pinkish red [flag icon](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/flag/) on the top bar on the website.

Faster vectoring and my personal fan-nism for [font awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) made me choose it. The other good thing is it takes load off [from my servers](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#fontawesome_tab).

The [community](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/community/) is constantly updating the toolkit and bringing new icons for production.
