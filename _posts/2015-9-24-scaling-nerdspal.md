title: Scaling nerdy site
---

I recently closed [nerdspal](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/nerdspal-closed/) to ensure new developments happens seemlessly.

There was no development as such however, I tweaked the server configuration a little. During this period:

 - Installed an 8 GB server RAM
 - Installed [missing IIS modules](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/launch-pre-requisites/)

This was a kung-fu experience.

So, why the heck I did this whole thing?

There are lot of nerds out there globally. While I was literally begging people to use my site, I realized that people from other corners of the world are showing interest. [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nerdspal.com) do not lie right?

Because the party is growing, I wanted to make sure the toilets do not get clogged.
