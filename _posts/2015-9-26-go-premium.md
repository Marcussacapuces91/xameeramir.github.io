Police do have a golden badge but we're not talking about police. We wanted to introduce premium members. They get a golden badge but there is [no police here](blogx.nerdspal.com/democratic-moderation/).

**Who are premium members?**

We award premium badge to all who have achieved at least 1000 marks. They successfully demonstrate:

 - Comunication skills
 - Leadership for solving the problems at hand
 - They respect their peers
 - Trying out new [things](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/stranger-danger/)
 
**Premium members will get:**

 - A special golden premium tag next to their [profile photo](https://nerdspal.com/Account/Profile)
 - Special access to use all the new featues in the future
