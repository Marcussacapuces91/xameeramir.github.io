title: Fiddling with emails
---

An [email](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/email-is-still-important-and-here-is-why/) is one of the first bet a startup make to it's users. Till date emails from [this sender](https://nerdspal.com) are so **ugly**  [no-no](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-hate-email-so-passionately).

So, I took my make-up-man hat on. To beautify them, there are so many tools but I [fiddled](http://jsfiddle.net/user/xameeramir) my day to [invite people smartly](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/oa8mu7se/), to [confirm their accounts](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/tfud90y3/), to [welcome them well](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/c560ruet/) and to help them [recover their accounts](http://jsfiddle.net/xameeramir/usovyb9q/),.

#jsfiddle also give options to collaborate in real time.

So people working remotely can get into one project at the same time. Obviously, you need an internet connection.

A lot of things in [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com) need redesigning. I'm starting with the most critical ones first.
