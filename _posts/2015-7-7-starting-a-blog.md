title: Here you come - choosing a blog platform
---

Anyone there? So, here you are... Yes talking to you!

Since many days I was thinking to build a platform to share our thoughts and ask for advice about what I build.

I thought about [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/). We loved tumblr for some *pew pew* reason.

This blog is written using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which was never in my mind. It offers quite simple ways to get our blog [up and ready](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Yes, it doesn't make us feel *pew pew* but it's nice enough to get our job done.

So, this blog is where we will meet again and again.
