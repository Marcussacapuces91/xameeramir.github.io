"A great place to work" - whenever I hear this phrase, one name comes to my mind. The place of fun, knowledge and the place to do what you love. Surely - [NextServices](http://www.nextservices.com/). In one of the non trivial meetings, I heard [someone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suthrum) saying -

>What we are learning here - collectively as an org is going to be more and more relevant for what you can do in your life.

**The place to have fun**

I don't know how this harmony is maintained in our corporate house amidst [Mind space](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Mindspace,+Malad+West,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra/@19.183452,72.832431,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3be7b6f20d58fb8d:0x96111c9adf8e84ca). The fun activities we perform add more bounce to what we do.

These fun activities are especially an opportunity for re-opening arms. An opportunity to do something unusual. To become a kid again :D

**The technology forced org**

The way we have leveraged the technology is amazing. Letting people do more work through automations. Having an in-house [certified EHR](https://enkiworld.com/newenki/portal/index.php), available across platforms does proves what we call ourselves - a technology forced org!
