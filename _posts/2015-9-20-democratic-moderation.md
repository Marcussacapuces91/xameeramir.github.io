title: Democratic moderation
---

A lot of people scream about the moderation policies used by other community driven sites. I was thinking of a [democratic](https://nerdspal.com/Home/Overview#Democratic) moderation mode.


<h1> <span style="color:#50D050; text-align:center"> Democratic - it is yours, by you and for you </span> </h1>

A healthy and democratic moderation will help keep the dirty spammers off as the community grows.

 - You do not need **x** number of points to prove your editing intelligence
 - You do not need **x** number of points to award points to a useful post
 - etc.


To make sure that moderation doesn't become [suppression of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship) by anonymous police, [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com) will show you who have made changes to your post.
