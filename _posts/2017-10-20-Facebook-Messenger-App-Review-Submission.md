To publish a bot on the Facebook the following stuff are required to be ready:

 - Icon: You can upload a JPG, GIF or PNG file. The size of the image must be 1024 x 1024 pixels. File size limit 5 MB
 - App display name
 - Contact Email – In case if anyone (or Facebook) wants to contact a company
 - Category – the business category for which bot is getting published
 - Privacy policy URL
 - Terms of Service URL
 - Video - You'll be prompted to upload a screen-cast of your chat-bot working
 - Facebook page

Most of the above stuff can be done with common sense and below is the actual review submission.

If the app submission is approved/rejected, Facebook sends a notification. Also, the App Review section will show the green ticks to approved permissions, if the permissions are granted.
