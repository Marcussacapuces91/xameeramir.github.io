It was recently that I went too much into [server](/launch-pre-requisites/) and database administration.

I spent a lot of time maintaining than building. Now, I wanted to say goodbye to it. I'm trying to get my hands dirty with [plesk](http://www.odin.com/products/plesk/).

It looks like it will reduce costs by **10x** - the actual benefit of choosing it.

At the same time, I may lose that tight control offered by cloudy options.
