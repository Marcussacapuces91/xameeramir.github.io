It was recently that I went too much into [server](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/launch-pre-requisites/) and database administration. Doing it for others vs doing it for yourself has a big diferrence.

I spent a lot of time maintaining than building. Now, I wanted to say goodbye to it. I'm trying to get my hands dirty with [plesk](http://www.odin.com/products/plesk/).

It looks like it will reduce costs by **10x** - the actual benefit of choosing it.

At the same time, I'm may lose that tight control offered by cloudy options. I'm not at all interested in control or authority, I just want to see my vision implemented.
