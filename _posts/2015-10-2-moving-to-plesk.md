It was recently that I went too much into [server](/launch-pre-requisites/) and database administration for hosting [ASP.NET on  cloud](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/solution/click-to-deploy-images/aspnet)

I spent a lot of time maintaining than building. Now, I'm trying to get my hands dirty with [plesk](http://www.odin.com/products/plesk/).

Hosting providers provide plesk as a packaged tool with hosting plans. Plesk helps you manage the hosting of your ASP.NET website. 

Shared hosting reduces site costs by **10x** - the actual benefit of choosing it.

At the same time, one may lose that tight control offered by cloudy options.
