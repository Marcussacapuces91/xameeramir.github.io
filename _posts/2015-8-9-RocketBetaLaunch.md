title: Nerdspal beta released!
---

In our [last blog post](http://nistenblog.github.io/RocketLaunch/#) we said that our project [#RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com/) will serve as the implementation of the understanding we gathered through our works. We have released a [beta for the same](https://104.197.88.155/)

#What this project is all about?

The core idea is to help you as a student to get what you want. You may be looking for some homework help or some kind of an online course. Is that *right*?

So say you have a school, college or university level question for which you need an answer. Your question may be a mathematical sum,  chemistry equation, a accounts ledger query or an essay. In short you have a question which is **related to your studies**. Go ahead and ask them at [nerdspal](http://nerdspal.com/).
