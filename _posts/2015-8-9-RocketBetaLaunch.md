In our [last blog post](http://nistenblog.github.io/RocketLaunch/#) we said that our project [#RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com/) will serve as the implementation of the understanding we gathered through our works. To support our words, have released a [beta for the same](https://104.197.88.155/)

#nerdspal is a place to get help in your academic efforts

So say you have a school, college or university level question for which you need an answer. Your question may be:

 - a difficult mathematical sum,
 - some complex chemistry equation, 
 - an accounts ledger query,
 - a wordy essay,
 - etc.

In short you have a question which is **related to your studies**. Go ahead and ask them at [nerdspal](https://104.197.88.155/Questions/Create).


We were very much confident about [our vision](https://twitter.com/nistencorp/status/626978947536809984) that nerdspal will help you as a student to get all kind of help in your academic efforts. Help us implement this vision.
