To publish a bot on the Facebook the following stuff are required to be ready:

 - **Icon**: You can upload a JPG, GIF or PNG file. The size of the image must be 1024 x 1024 pixels. File size limit 5 MB
 - **App display name**
 - **Contact Email** – In case if anyone (or Facebook) wants to contact a company
 - **Category** – the business category for which bot is getting published
 - **Privacy policy URL**
 - **Terms of Service URL**
 - **Video** - You'll be prompted to upload a screen-cast of your chat-bot working
 - **Facebook page**

Most of the above stuff can be done with common sense and below is the actual review submission.

**Add messenger in Products if not already added**

**Add permissions required by the app**

Go to the Messenger tab in the App Dashboard. Find the App Review section and select the permissions needed by the app.

**Edit Notes for Each Submission**

After selecting the permissions, one can edit the notes for each submission. Click on <kbd>Edit Notes</kbd> for each permission. Make sure to fill each form and any other missing items before clicking <kbd>Submit for Review</kbd>.

Facebook will need confirmation before submission:

**Submit for Approval**

Once you've submitted your app, you can view the App Review section to see the status of your approval.

**Approval**

Sometimes, the approval can be partial too:

If the app submission is approved/rejected, Facebook sends a notification. Also, the App Review section will show the green ticks to approved permissions, if the permissions are granted.

That's it.
