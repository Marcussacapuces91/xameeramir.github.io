title: Google cloud business conference in Mumbai
---

I recently visited Google's cloud conference in Hyatt. Disruptive startups like [Freshdesk](http://freshdesk.com) were also featured. This attendance helped me take my first step in cloud technologies.

A lot of things came up and one line which I still remember is:

> People do not buy technology, they buy what it does for them

A project shall confirm to this phrase.
