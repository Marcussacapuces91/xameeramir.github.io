I recently visited a cloud conference sponsored by [Google](https://twitter.com/GoogleforWork/status/623085960176103425). Disruptive startups like [Freshdesk](http://freshdesk.com) were also featured. I initially thought that the company is a small call center kind of firm. I found myself wronged when I heard they [acquired](http://blog.1click.io/1click-joins-freshdesk/) [1click](https://1click.io/) while they're still raising [funds](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/04/20/freshdesk-raises-fresh-50-million/).

This attendance helped me take first steps in cloud technologies.

A lot of things came up and one line which I still remember is:

> People do not buy technology, they buy what it does for them

We were shown how cloud technologies can help reduce on premise cost and resources.

 - You can create and destroy instances in minutes
 - Take entire control of your IT infrastructure in your own hands
 - Pause instances to avoid unbearable bills
 - Pay as you go
 - Get backup and security of your data and apps
 - And many more
