title: Pausing nerdspal
---

I'm excited to announce that for few days, I'm pausing nerdspal.com website to support development of some newer modules.

The reason the beta was launched was to understand the criticality and problems of releasing software.

As, I have received a lot of useful comments and feedback, I wanted to wind up and start focusing on implementing the new features.
