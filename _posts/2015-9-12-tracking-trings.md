title: Tracking trings
---

After the [beta release](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/beta-launching/) of [project #RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com), I received a lot of suggestions from my friends and colleagues. One of them was better tracking of answers and comments on posts.

So to meet those [suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tmL5Is22aNc6pfALj--OatM5TnhjJLZd50auN3WgM24/viewanalytics), below is the plan:

 - Notifications for new answers to question owner
 
 The question owner will recieve a notification saying "Hey, you got a new answer for that question"
 
 - Notifications for new comments to the question owner

 The question owner will recieve a notification saying "Hey, you got a new comment for that question".

 - Notifications to other commenters on the same post

 If there are any commenters on the same post, they will also get notified.
 
 - Notification for post edits

 If there is any edit to the post (except comments), the post owner will get notified.
 
 Let me give it a nice name: **project tring**
