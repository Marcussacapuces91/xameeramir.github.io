Help us implement this vision.

>So how does nerdspal can come to help?

#Ask your questions

So say you have a school, college or university level question for which you need an answer. Your question may be:

 - a difficult mathematical sum,
 - some complex chemistry equation, 
 - an accounts ledger query,
 - a wordy essay,
 - etc.

In short you have a question which is **related to your studies**. Go ahead and [ask them](http://nerdspal.com/Questions/Create) at nerdspal.

#Complement your academic profile

When you post something on nerdspal, your post is accompanied with a marks awarding section. Your [peers](http://beta.nerdspal.com/Account/League) can award marks to them based upon the usefulness, clarity and all those nice *things*. This adds up your total marks.

Finally demonstrable on your profile page.

#Quality on high

The most interesting part: there is no waste here at nerdspal. All users of the website are expected to maintain a nice decorum. The filthy posts can be identified by voting them down.
