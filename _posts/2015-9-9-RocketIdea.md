#Complement your academic profile

When you post something on nerdspal, your post is accompanied with a marks awarding section. Your [peers](https://nerdspal.com/Account/League) can award marks to them based upon the usefulness, clarity and all those nice *things*. This adds up your total marks.

Finally demonstrable on your profile page.

#Quality on high

The most interesting part: there is no waste here at nerdspal. All users of the website are expected to maintain a nice decorum. The filthy posts can be identified by voting them down.

#Why shall I share my valuable knowledge?

>It might be very easy to solve your friend's doubt through WhatsApp or email. If you use nerdspal, your contribution will not only help us, it will also be available to people across globe.

>[nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com) is currently a baby startup which is going through it's most difficult phase. The phase of **user acceptance**. We need people like you who can use it and [provide honest feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tmL5Is22aNc6pfALj--OatM5TnhjJLZd50auN3WgM24/viewanalytics).

Much inspired by [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) *(which can help you with generic queries)* and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) *(the programming Q&A site)* but our domain is sharp focused on academics.
We are very much confident about [our vision](https://twitter.com/nistencorp/status/626978947536809984) that nerdspal will complement student acadmic profile. Pehleez, help us implement this vision.
