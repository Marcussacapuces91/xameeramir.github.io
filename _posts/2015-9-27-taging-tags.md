Finding *that* someone or something in a crowd is a ~~little bit~~ difficult task.

How do nerdspal solve this problem? **tags**? Yes!

**What are tags on nerdspal?**

A tag is a field of study under which a question is posted. Each tag represents an area of study like [HTML](https://nerdspal.com/Questions/Tagged?field=HTML), [intellectual property](https://nerdspal.com/Questions/Tagged?field=Intellectual%20property), [law](https://nerdspal.com/Questions/Tagged?field=Law).

**Why a tag is important?**

A tag ensures that the posts are categorized under correct field of study. So searching for a post becomes more easy.

So you do need to trouble searching your *glasses* anymore.
