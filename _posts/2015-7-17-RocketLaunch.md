#Our very first launch!

We are working on our project [#RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com/). Initially, our most efforts were directed towards making it cost effective using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/). Somehow we understood that in order to save business expenses we are delaying it's global demo.

The other day, we realized that the [user shall be kept first](http://www.google.co.in/about/company/philosophy/). The other things will fall in place. Believing in this philosophy, we are taking the risk of deploying it to [windows servers](http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2012-r2/) instead of initially planned [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)


#What this project is all about?

This project is all about students and academia. Working in the academia, we understood different requirements of students. This project will serve as the implementation of the understanding we gathered through our works.

The core idea is to help you as a student to get what you want. You may be looking for some [homework help](https://www.chegg.com/study) or some kind of an [online course](https://www.khanacademy.org/). The options are abundant. We are going to add something better!

>What is that better?

The answer is wait and watch!
