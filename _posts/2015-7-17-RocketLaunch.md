title: A rocket to the moon!
---

We are working on our project [#RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com/). Initially, our most efforts were directed towards making it cost effective using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/). Somehow we understood that in order to save business expenses we are delaying it's global demo.

The other day, we realized that the [user shall be kept first](http://www.google.co.in/about/company/philosophy/). The other things will fall in place. Believing in this philosophy, we are taking the risk of deploying it to [windows servers](http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2012-r2/) instead of initially planned [ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/).

*If we lose - we guide. If we win - we lead.* This is the core of our risk taking strategy.

>Because, sometimes when you do [something new](http://nerdspal.com/), you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly and get on to improve your [other things](http://nordible.com/).

#This is our very first launch!

The *die-hard* launch will be done after becoming 100% sure of the working of the project as suggested by one of our mentors [Deepak](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jadhavdeepak).

Initially a group of selected students across the globe will get free access to the beta project. These beta users will be awarded free lifetime access.

#Die-hard launch

Once all the features and paths are properly tested. We will get up our servers.

#What this project is all about?

This project is all about students and academia. Working in the academia, we understood different requirements of students. This project will serve as the implementation of the understanding we gathered through our works.

The core idea is to help you as a student to get what you want. You may be looking for some [homework help](https://www.chegg.com/study) or some kind of an [online course](https://www.khanacademy.org/). The options are abundant. We are going to add something better!

>What is that better?

The answer is *wait and watch!*
