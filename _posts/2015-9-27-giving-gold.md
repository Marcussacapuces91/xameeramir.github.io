[project **#RocketToTheMoon**](https://nerdspal.com) aka nerdspal.com is a stranger, trusting it would be a bit gutsy. 

To recognise that guts, I had promised some special [worms](http://getworm.com/startup/nerdspal/) for our 1000 early adopters. A [gold premium badge](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/go-premium/) with **bonus 1001 marks**.

The only reason of blindly awarding people 1k of marks is their ability to try out a completely strange thing. 

[Dannon](https://nerdspal.com/Account/Profile/54/dannonl) is the first person to receive such badge on nerdspal. If you subscribe through [**Get worms**](http://getworm.com/startup/nerdspal/) and get yours.
