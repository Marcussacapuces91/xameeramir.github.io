title: Hello world!
---

My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from [the city of dreams](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). For some *personal* reasons I dopped out from [my last school](http://www.nmims.edu/). When I was leaving, a few of my friends sent me farewell emails.

One day, I was going through those emails. One of them took my attention, I started re-reading this part of an email:

>Hope I see you opening a multinational company, where I see a great leader and an entrepreneur just like you and I hope I have a chance of discussing this beautiful dream of you being a great friend and a famous person to my friends and my loved ones.

>I wish you good luck for your future endeavours.

To be honest, I didn't did anything so great for them. I kept re-reading these paras and realized how they were trying to motivate me.

I asked myself - why can't I do something worthy?

I started thinking about a project idea to solve some serious problems. One of the most common problems which most of the parents face is **academic tutoring** for their child.

Especially in cities, parents do not have so much of time to sit with and solve their kids' academic doubts and thus they hire tutors. To solve this problem I started a project called [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com). I'll talk about this more in my upcoming posts.
