When I was leaving, a few of my friends sent me farewell emails.

One day, I was going through those emails. One of them took my attention, I started re-reading this part of an email:

>I wish you good luck for your future endeavours.

I kept re-reading this line and realized how they were trying to motivate me. I smiled and went a little nervous.

I had big dreams but I lacked courage. At my last school, I found my **love** and then a series of discoveries happened. Programming came more closer to me.
