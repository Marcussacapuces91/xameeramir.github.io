title: The departure from &beta;

If a software seems to be stable, it's still wise to keep that *careful* ***&beta;*** *symbol*. 

The only way to decide things is **by doing**.

I feel that if a software can address users' problems it is worth. Give the software as a toy in user's hands. If **(and only if)** they start playing with it, it's really cool. Some kids like to break toys also.
