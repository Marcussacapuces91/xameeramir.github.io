title: The departure from &beta;
---

[nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com/) seems to be stable now but still I wanted to keep that careful &beta; symbol. I always worked as a windows app developer. To get started into web based development, I started working on this nerdy site. 

Just today, I gave order of 2k stickers as the first marketing endeavour for nerdspal. So by tomorrow or the day after, I will be able to get started with spreading of word. **Two thousand?** may look difficult but not impossible. I am estimating that in 1 week I will be able to hand over all the stickers to almost all major college students.

Why the heck I can say nerdspal will not work? Who knows about it? No one. The only way I'll decide things is **by doing**. I really don't believe in astrology.

Which student will not like if they get answers for their academic queries? They will love it. They pay for it [online](https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers) and offline both. This is a real problem.

I'm dedicating october towards deciding my foolishness. If **(and only if)** nerdspal is not something which [helps users](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec07/), the best thing will be to shut it. I don't want to force anything on anyone.

These 2k stickers will help me decide how stupid I'm. I did this because I believe that:

> It's better to try and fail then to never try.

If eventually I fail, at least I'll be happy that I tried something which I was always afraid of. Having experience of a startup is really cool (and a little painful).

I understand that [traction](https://www.quora.com/Startup-Traction/How-do-social-sites-e-g-Hunch-Foursquare-Reddit-Digg-go-from-1-to-1000K-users) is the most important element here. I also understand that my vision shall not be a [blind passion](http://www.examiner.com/article/how-blind-passion-can-lead-you-straight-off-the-cliff).

If things work well:

 - I wanted a team. Not employees but partners to push things forward.
 - I wanted investors to extend help to every student of the entire globe.

else:

 - I'll select one of the big breaks.
 
And thinking is free.
