title: The departure from &beta;

If a software seems to be stable, it's still wise to keep that *careful* ***&beta;*** *symbol*. 

The only way to decide things is **by doing**. I really don't believe in astrology.

I feel that if a software can address users' problems it is worth doing.

I usually dedicate some time deciding my foolishness. If **(and only if)** the software is not something which helps users, the best thing is to shut it without forcing anything on anyone.

I do stuff because I believe that:

> It's better to try and fail then to never try.

If eventually you fail, at least you'll be happy that you tried something which you were always afraid of. Having experience of a failure is really cool (and a little painful).

I understand that usage is the most important element for a software's success. I also understand that a vision shall not be a [blind passion](http://www.examiner.com/article/how-blind-passion-can-lead-you-straight-off-the-cliff).
