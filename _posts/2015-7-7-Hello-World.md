Anyone there? So, here you are... Yes we are talking to you!

Since many days we were thinking to build a platform to share our thoughts and ask for advice about what we are building here at [nistencorp](http://nistencorp.com/). Especially about our [project FF7](http://nerdspal.com/) (sounds a little speedy, right?) which was in our mind since very long.

We thought about [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/). We loved tumblr for some *pew pew* reason.

This blog is written using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which was never in our mind. [It offers quite simple ways to get our blog up and ready](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Yes, it doesn't make us feel *pew pew* but it's nice enough to get our job done.

So, this blog is where we will meet again and again. We need people like you to advice us. Your recommendations are very important. Just like you! 

<!--Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.-->
