>**[nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com) is currently a baby startup which is going through it's most initial phase. The phase of user acceptance. We need people like you who can use it and [provide honest feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tmL5Is22aNc6pfALj--OatM5TnhjJLZd50auN3WgM24/viewanalytics).**

<p class="casual"> Much inspired by Quora (which can help you with generic queries) and Stackoverflow (the programming Q&A site) but our domain is sharp focused on academics.
We are very much confident about our vision that nerdspal will complement all kind of academic efforts. Please, help us implement this vision. </p>
