title: Track your tring tring
---

If you are moving along with me, I was setting up an [alarming system](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/tracking-trings/) for [nerdspal community](https://nerdspal.com/Account/League) - I called **project tring**

So, the **so awesome news** is that you can start tracking your tringing alarms. In other way - the project is succesfully finished.

Any new answers or comments will be shown next to a `pink + red + orange` colored [font-awesome flag icon](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/flag/).

Faster vectoring and fan-nism of [font awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) made me choose it. The other good thing is that it doesn't forces [my own servers to load things](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#fontawesome_tab).

The [community](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/community/) is constantly updating the toolkit and bringing new icons for production constantly. Hats off guys!
