My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from Mumbai.
For some pew bling reason I dopped out from [NMIMS](http://www.nmims.edu/). To keep my time from wasting, I started a side project which I called [nerdspal.com](https://nerdspal.com]

I started writing this blog for a more selfish reason - to track the way I think. To refer back and re-inforce the commitments I make. I don't know how things are going to be later, but the best way to know it is to **just do it**

I had lost all my hopes with a decision to live a plain life. I spent a few weeks in the black dark

One day, I was going through the farewell emails I received from my friends. I started re-reading this email from Varun:

Dear Zameer,

Its sad to see you leave us suddenly, we were like family. I am so sure that whatever decision you have made is the right one and for a good reason. Thanks a lot for that beautiful email you wrote us, it was one of the best emails I have ever read in my entire life. The way you presented the email broke our hearts when we read it. Hats off to you brother. Hope you come  to see us regularly. Am already missing all the fun and laughter we had over these few months.

I must say you have the potential of being a great human being and yes!! you are no doubt. Any help you require in life no matter what please don't hesitate to contact me am like a brother to you. Hope I see you opening a multinational company, where I see a great leader and an entrepreneur just like you and I hope I have a chance of discussing this beautiful dream of you being a great friend and a famous person to my friends and my loved ones.

I wish you good luck for your future endeavours.
Keep smiling always, cause you make others smile as well.:)


P.S: Do keep messaging frequently...


I kept re-reading these paras. I stopped there for a moment and realized how others see me. They see a potential in me, why can't I do something worthy? I started thinking about problems which are mostly faced by students. One of the most common problem which most of the students and parents face is

After dropping out of the college, I got a lot of free time.
