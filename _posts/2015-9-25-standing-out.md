I am also planning to initiate some hardcore marketing efforts for [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com/), but before that I wanted to keep some swag ready for [new and already nerds](https://nerdspal.com/Account/League). Of course, it's part of [#LoveThyUser](http://nistencorp.com/) initiative. I'll talk about this swag thing in my upcoming posts, it's better to brag less and do more.
