This is [Zameer](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/xameeramir) from [India's financial capital](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). I have graduated in IT from [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in). I believe that by *doing yourself* and by interacting with other people, one can learn a lot.

[Here](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0964ab778245068b9d910764125004c9) is my [avatar](https://gravatar.com/)

Currently, Iâ€™m a [full stack software engineer  and technical evangelist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xameeramir) for [NextServices](http://www.nextservices.com/) responsible for programming web and desktop applications based on [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) with [MySql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) and [MSSql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) databases. Configuring servers and keeping them healthy with the help of SysAdmins. Doing front-end with CSS and javascript.

I work closely with operations including [C suite](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-suite.asp). Listening carefully, asking questions and collaborating with people both inside and outside of organization.

I'm a continuous learner with a **go do it** attitude. Educating others help me learn & grow more. I prefer [staying up to date with the industry](http://techcrunch.com/), reading a lot of [*technical*](http://blog.codinghorror.com/) and [formal](https://www.themuse.com/) articles, contribute to the [community](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [stay mission focused](http://xameeramir.github.io/), physically fit and mentally calm.
