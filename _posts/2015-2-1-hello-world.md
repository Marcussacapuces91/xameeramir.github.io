This is [Zameer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mezb2hkgj6fv8o/ZameerAnsariExpressBio.pdf?dl=0) from [India's financial capital](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). I have graduated in IT from [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in). I believe that by **learning yourself** and **doing yourself** you can build more software.

I'm a continuous learner with a "go do it" attitude. Across different roles I performed, I have learned and implemented different soft skills especially communication and empathy.

Currently, Iâ€™m a [full stack software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xameeramir) for [NextServices](http://www.nextservices.com/) responsible for programming .NET applications and databases. Configuring web servers and keeping them healthy with the help of system administrators. I work closely with operations and development teams including C suite. Collaborate with people both inside and outside of organization to help the operations processes automated.

I like to act as a trainer. Yes, teaching others help me learn more. I like reading technical and formal articles, staying physically fit and mentally calm.

This is something which looks so true to me -
