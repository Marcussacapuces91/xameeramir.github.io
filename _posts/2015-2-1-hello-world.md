This is Zameer from [India's financial capital](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). I have graduated in IT from [Mumbai University](http://mu.ac.in). Dropped out from [NMIMS](http://www.nmims.edu/) because I believe that by learning yourself you can built more software.

Currently, Iâ€™m a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xameeramir) for [Next Services](http://www.nextservices.com/) (a healthcare IT firm) focused on .NET and database programming. In this role I complement the staff efforts, overseeing requirements for people
from many teams.

I represent the company and team to external technical solution providers and internal teams including
top executives. I also act as a technical trainer for new joinees.
