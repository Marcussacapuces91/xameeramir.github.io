title: No Place Like Home
---

The days at home.

Long they have gone!

It's walls and the woods.

I don't those goods.

And that homely feeling.

It's gone forever!

The food in my plate, with family to my next.

The sleep of night. The smile and sight.

Missed it? Yes.

But the journey. Still goes.

A day at home. Nothing more than that.

And heard somewhere, no place like home.
