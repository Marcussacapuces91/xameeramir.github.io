Recently, I was just going through some documents. I saw something which caught my eyes. It was a word I never heard before (or maybe heard and forgot). Quickly a question came up.

> What is this [break-even](http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/12/how-to-perform-a-break-even-analysis.html) point?

I spoke to one of [our partner](http://www.nextservices.com/become-a-partner) [guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duttaarup) about the same. From here onwards comes his words:

Let's take a transaction example:

 - You bought goods for $90 - **purchase**
 - You sold goods for $100 - **sale**
 - You also paid $5 - **miscellaneous cost such as tax, transport etc**

Here, investment - $90 + $5 = $95
Profit per transaction - $5

Break even point is where you have recovered your investments and made zero profit.

After this point your actual revenue starts.

Now, how many iterations (ket's say **X**) one need to perform in order to recover that initial investment of $95 with $5 profit each time?

It's $5 multiply by  **X** = $95

Here, it's simple 19 iterations.

In this example, after 19 succesful iterations, one will reach to break-even point.
