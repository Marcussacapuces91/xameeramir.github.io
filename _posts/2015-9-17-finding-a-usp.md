I had a question and need to make a decision for the same.

Say we have all the teachers of the city on [this website](https://nerdspal.com/) - will it be a nice [USP](http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/unique-selling-proposition-usp)? Because the users will have doubts about the credibility of the answers. And who the heck will answer?

Because teachers are day to day into the textbooks, pencils and sharpners - they are credible. Yeah?

Just wanted to validate this USP before committing this. 

This looks like a problem - students do need their academic doubts to be solved, (the founding reason of so many tuitions in cities) so saying "Hey, we have all the teachers here" will work?
