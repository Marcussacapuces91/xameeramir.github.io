One of the worst thing one may really hate to do is mundane form filling. We have a few [old projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) who really do just that. For a healthcare provider or a medical billing company, your staff is probably doing some manual [eligibility verification](http://www.google.com/search?q=insurance+eligibility+verification). This is unfortunately too much business cost and effort.

Recently I found that [Instamed](http://www.instamed.com/) - a healthcare payment solution provider can fill the void. Yeah, I'm looking at [that API lollypop](http://developers.instamed.com/).

If you're already a healthcare company using their solutions and (obviously) paying for it. Having an API integrated will make you brag more in parties. You don't need to be worried about that maintenance and regressions.

[Here](http://www.nextservices.com/), this looks really relevant. Let me get my hair pulled for simplifying that eligibility process.
