Since a very long time I was thinking about the problem for users to adopt [nerdspal](http://nerdspal.com). I'm feeling that the change of platform will help.

Initially, I started buliding nerdspal on web with a feeling that it will be easy for my users to get it anywhere. I'm feeling that if I can change the platform to mobile, things will become more easy.

I'm thinking of [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) as my preferred choice. This will completely be a new experience. I have 7-9 views which needs to be rendered on mobile. I have a lot of other things to be added.

I'm considering the **"web"** project [failed](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/bye-bye-beta/) and it's totally fine. Even [Phil](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/30/evernote-on-failure) agrees.

I will keep this as the side project now. Yes, I'll keep developing this in my spare time. Because I learnt a lot of things which I never thought before. It changed the way I work.

That change would have never came without this extraordinary experience.
