Since a very long time I was thinking about the problem for users to adopt any software. I'm feeling that the change of platform will help.

Initially, I started buliding apps on desktop and web with a feeling that it will be easy for my users. I'm feeling that if I can change the platform to mobile, things will become more easy.

I'm thinking of [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) as my preferred choice. This will completely be a [new experience](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33152154/is-ionic-framework-free).

I'm considering the web and desktop projects **old** and it's totally fine. Even [Satya](http://www.informationweek.com/software/enterprise-applications/microsofts-mobile-first-cloud-first-strategy-explained/d/d-id/1234865) agrees.

Yes, I'll still develop those stuff in my spare time. Because I learnt a lot of things which I never thought before.
