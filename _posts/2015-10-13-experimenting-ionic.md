Since a very long time I was thinking about the problem for users to adopt any software. I'm feeling that mobile is taking large part of the user base. [Android](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougolenick/2015/05/27/apple-ios-and-google-android-smartphone-market-share-flattening-idc/)'s future is looking promising.

In my current day job, I bulid projects on desktop and web. I'm finding mobile as more of a long running horse.

I'm thinking of [hybrid mobile apps](http://ionicframework.com/) as my preferred choice. This will completely be a [new experience](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33152154/is-ionic-framework-free).

Even [Satya](https://news.microsoft.com/2014/03/27/satya-nadella-mobile-first-cloud-first-press-briefing/) agrees.
