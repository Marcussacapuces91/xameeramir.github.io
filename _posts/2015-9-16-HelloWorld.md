title: Hello world!

My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from Mumbai. My last school was [NMIMS](http://www.nmims.edu/).
For some *pew bling* reasons I dopped out from there. After the drop out, I had made a decision to live a plain life.

One day, I was going through the farewell emails I received from my friends. I started re-reading this part of email from Varun:


>I must say you have the potential of being a great human being and yes!! you are no doubt. Any help you require in life no matter what please don't hesitate to contact me am like a brother to you. Hope I see you opening a multinational company, where I see a great leader and an entrepreneur just like you and I hope I have a chance of discussing this beautiful dream of you being a great friend and a famous person to my friends and my loved ones.

>I wish you good luck for your future endeavours.
>Keep smiling always, cause you make others smile as well.:)

>P.S: Do keep messaging frequently...

To be honest, I didn't did anything so great for them but still they recognized me as a nice lad.

I kept re-reading these paras and realized how others see me. They see a potential in me, so why can't I do something worthy? 

I started thinking about problems which are mostly faced by students. One of the most common problem which most of the students and parents face is the **academic doubts**.

Especially in cities, parents do not have so much of time to sit with and solve their kids academic doubts and thus they hire tutors or admit their kids to tuitions.

After dropping out of the college, I got a lot of free time and to keep my time from wasting, I started a side project which I called [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com)

I started writing this blog for a more selfish reason - to track the way I think. To refer back and re-inforce the commitments I make. I don't know how things are going to be later, but the best way to know it is to **just do it**
