How do [nerdspal](https://nerdspal.com/) handle too much info thing?

Say, if I give you food when you are thirsty or worse if I give you too much food? Will you appreciate that? It's **ok-ok**.

I asked this question to myself when I was doing renovation of question listing pages on project **[#RocketToTheMoon](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/rocket-launch/)** aka nerdspal this day.

As a result of this brainstorming, only certain information is shown as long as question filtering is concerned, such as:

[unanswered question](https://nerdspal.com/Questions?Sort=Unanswered) will show number of answers as **zero**, [newest](https://nerdspal.com/Questions?Sort=Newest) will show the date when the question was asked, [popular questions](https://nerdspal.com/Questions?Sort=Popular) will pop up number of views.

The questions which are [alive](https://nerdspal.com/Questions?Sort=Live) will show how many edits were made to them, by whom and when.

[aged](https://nerdspal.com/Questions?Sort=Oldest) questions will show off the oldest posts in question category.

I'm building the project with simplicity and smartness [both](https://nerdspal.com/Home/Overview#SmartSimple) both in mind.

This delayed the [question banking](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/question-banking/). I need to think again on how this can be achieved.
