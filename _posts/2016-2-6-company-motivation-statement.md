I have read many company values but the ones from [Google](https://www.google.com/about/company/philosophy/), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values) looked most logical.

Thinking of how people write, I tried to jump in and here is a fleshy document stating a nice company's motivation.

# Focus on user

We build everything from the ground up with **you** in mind. Whether it's something new or an enhancement, it is forced to serve **you**.

Believing this give us enough confidence that, everything else will follow us.

 - make products **insanely quick**, before light emits from it's source
 - show products **simple**, clean and smart
 - **democratize** and respect it
 - **donâ€™t #@!%** the user

# Innovate with focus

 - **hack** - a lot, break your head (not mirrors), repeat
 - do **one** thing really, really good
 - follow 80-20 rule - **impact**ful?, do it. Otherwise, throw it
 - always ask this - **is there a need?**
 - **balance** 
 
# Be bold and honest

Doing big things requires lot of courage. Be bold, **just do it**.

- **no politics**
- **no fear**ful decisions
- take responsibilities and **collaborate**
- take risks, **inpire** and have fun
- fail and **fail faster**
- **don't evil** for money

Be open, **honest**, confident and integrated. That's how we want to be known. It allows us to make better decisions. As clear as a brand new mirror.
