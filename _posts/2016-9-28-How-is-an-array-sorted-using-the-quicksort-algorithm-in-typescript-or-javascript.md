title: How is an array sorted using the quicksort algorithm in typescript or javascript?
---

This is one of the most famous question asked during interviews. I have suggested the following typescript / relevant javascript solution:


<script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/nordible/quickSort-typescript/blob/master/src/index.ts"></script>

Pretty cool right?

This is published as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quicksort-typescript) too
