title: How is an array sorted using the quicksort algorithm in typescript or javascript?
---

This is one of the most famous question asked during interviews. I have suggested the following typescript / relevant javascript solution:


<iframe frameborder="0" style="top:0px; left:0px; bottom:0px; right:0px; width:100%; height:100vh; border:none; margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden;" src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/nordible/quickSort-typescript/blob/master/src/index.ts" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Pretty cool right?
