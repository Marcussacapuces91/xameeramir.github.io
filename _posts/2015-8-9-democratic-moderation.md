title: Democratic moderation
---

A lot of people scream about the moderation policies used by other community driven sites. I was thinking of a [democratic](https://nerdspal.com/Home/Overview#Democratic) moderation mode.

Moderation will help keep the dirty spammers off as the community grows. I have built modules such that:

 - You do not need **x** number of points to prove your editing intelligence
 - You do not need **x** number of points to award points to a useful post
 - etc.

> So, you get all the community rights from the day you [become awesome by joining the site](https://nerdspal.com/Account/Register).
