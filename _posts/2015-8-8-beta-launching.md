In my [last blog post](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/nerdspal-launch-plan/#) I said that our project [#RocketToTheMoon](http://nerdspal.com/) will serve as the implementation of the understanding we gathered through our works. To support our words, have released a beta for the same.

The project is currently under deployment testing and overall beta testing. 

I have tried to spread the word in *some* locations:
