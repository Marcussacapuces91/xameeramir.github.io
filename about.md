My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from Mumbai.
For some pew bling reason I dopped out from [NMIMS](http://www.nmims.edu/). 

I started writing this blog for a more selfish reason - to track the way I think. To refer back and re-inforce the commitments I make. I don't know how things are going to be later, but the best way to know it is to **just do it**
