My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from [the city of dreams](http://www.incredibleindia.org/travel/destination/mumbai/mumbai-introduction). For some *personal* reasons I dopped out from [my last school](http://www.nmims.edu/). I also founded [nerdspal.com](https://nerdspal.com/) - an academic Q & A website.

I started writing this blog for a more selfish reason - to track the way I think. To refer back and re-inforce the commitments I make. Because, I don't want to [fake myself](http://fakepreneur.me/)
