My name is Zameer, an (ab)normal dev from Mumbai. 
For some pew bling reason I dopped out from [NMIMS](http://www.nmims.edu/). I also founded [nerdspal.com](https://nerdspal.com/) as a way to get recognized for sharing your knowledge and [help parents and students](http://blogx.nerdspal.com/HelloWorld/).

I started writing this blog for a more selfish reason - to track the way I think. To refer back and re-inforce the commitments I make. I don't know how things are going to be later, but the best way to know it is to **just do it**
